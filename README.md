Understanding the mechanism of action (MoA) of drugs is crucial for drug discovery, development, and repositioning. Traditional methods for MoA elucidation often rely on experimental data and manual curation, both time-consuming and resource-intensive. This study presents a novel computational framework that integrates a comprehensive knowledge graph with large language models (LLMs) to enhance MoA analysis and facilitate the identification of similar drugs for repositioning. We constructed a multimodal knowledge graph incorporating diverse biological and chemical entities and their relationships from multiple authoritative databases, including STRING, HINT, Genome Alliance, Clinvar, MONDO, PathBank, KEGG, Reactome, DrugBank, LINCS, and CTD. We then leveraged state-of-the-art LLMs to embed MoA descriptions, enabling the calculation of semantic similarities alongside traditional graph-based similarity metrics, including Jaccard, Cosine, and Node2vec approaches. Our system provides a user-friendly web interface for exploring drug relationships and underlying MoAs. We demonstrated the utility of our approach through comprehensive correlation analysis and a detailed case study on Exenatide, showcasing the system's ability to identify drugs with similar MoAs and to potentially reveal new therapeutic applications. The correlation analysis revealed complementary relationships between different similarity metrics, with LLM-based approaches capturing distinct semantic aspects not fully represented by structural graph methods. The case study successfully identified known GLP-1 receptor agonists as similar to Exenatide, validating the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing mechanistically related drugs.
